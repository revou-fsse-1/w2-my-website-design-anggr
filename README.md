Welcome to Wareg, where we serve up delicious home-style cuisine that's both affordable and fresh. With a menu that changes every week, there's always something new and exciting to try. Plus, our easy-to-use website and mobile app make ordering a breeze.
But that's not all, the word "Wareg" has a special meaning in Javanese language, it means "satisfied and full" and that's exactly how we want you to feel after dining with us. So come on in, take a seat and let us take care of the rest. Satisfaction and fullness guaranteed!
